# Project Constitution: COBOL to Node.js Modernization

## Article I: Legacy Preservation Principle
All original COBOL code must be preserved in the repository for reference and historical context. The modernization process should maintain functional equivalence with the original system.

## Article II: Test-Driven Migration Mandate
Before modernizing any COBOL module, comprehensive test cases must be documented based on the original business logic. The Node.js implementation must pass all corresponding tests that validate the original COBOL behavior.

## Article III: Modular Architecture Imperative
The Node.js application must follow a modular architecture that mirrors the COBOL program structure (main, operations, data), ensuring clear separation of concerns and maintainability.

## Article IV: Educational Purpose Priority
This project serves as a learning resource for developers transitioning from COBOL to Node.js. All code, documentation, and implementation decisions must prioritize clarity and educational value over optimization.

## Article V: Functional Equivalence Gate
Every feature implemented in Node.js must demonstrate functional equivalence to the original COBOL implementation. Changes or improvements must be explicitly documented with justification.

## Article VI: GitHub Copilot Workflow Integration
The modernization process should demonstrate effective use of GitHub Copilot for code transformation, with clear examples of prompt engineering and iterative development practices.

## Article VII: Comprehensive Documentation Standard
All changes, decisions, and implementation approaches must be thoroughly documented in markdown format, including diagrams, test plans, and step-by-step guides.

## Article VIII: Zero Dependencies for Core Logic
The core business logic in Node.js should minimize external dependencies, using native Node.js features wherever possible to ensure long-term maintainability and reduce complexity.

## Article IX: Interactive Console Interface Mandate
The Node.js application must maintain an interactive console-based user interface similar to the original COBOL program, ensuring a familiar user experience during the transition.

## Article X: Incremental Migration Philosophy
The migration approach should be iterative and incremental, allowing developers to learn and validate each step before proceeding to the next component.
